# Precis

This is a collection of notes on statistics that attempt to provide further details and intuition for some topics, such as loss functions, information theory, information criteria, MCMC algorithms, etc. These notes are aimed primarily at future-me but I hope that might be useful others, which is why this material is **free to use** and is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives V4.0 International License](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/4.0/).
